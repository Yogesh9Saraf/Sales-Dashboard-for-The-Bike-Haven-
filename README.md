## Sales Dashboard for 'The Bike Haven' Domain

Project Overview:
This project focuses on creating an interactive and visually informative dashboard for The Bike Haven, a bike shop in San Francisco, to analyze its sales performance and track its business growth. The objective is to provide management with actionable insights into product, customer, and regional performance, and to compare actual sales with budgeted sales.

Key Steps and Features:
Data Preprocessing:

The data is sourced from multiple tables, including customer, sales, product, category, subcategory, and geography.
SQL queries are used to merge tables and remove unnecessary columns to create a clean dataset ready for visualization in Tableau.
Dashboard Visualizations:

Top 10 Products by Sales Amount: This chart highlights the top-selling products, helping management identify revenue drivers.
Top 10 Customers: Shows the highest-spending customers, enabling the company to focus on customer retention and loyalty programs.
Sales Figures vs. Budget: A chart comparing actual sales with the budget for each month, helping management identify areas where sales are falling short and take corrective actions.
Sales by Region/City: A map or chart that provides insights into which regions are performing best, helping to identify opportunities for expansion or targeted marketing.
Product Categories vs. Sales Amount: A graph that shows how different product categories are performing in terms of revenue, helping prioritize categories that require attention or additional marketing efforts.
Additional Visualizations:

The dashboard also includes custom charts and filters to provide a more granular view of sales trends based on user preferences, such as filtering by product type, sales representative, or region.
Interactivity:

Filters are applied to allow users to view data specific to customers, products, and time periods. The dashboard is designed to be responsive and accessible on multiple devices, ensuring ease of use across the organization.
Final Deliverables:

A detailed, interactive dashboard saved in PDF format.
A video demonstrating the functionality of the dashboard, including the use of filters and how they impact the displayed data.
